On the other hand, Web3.Storage looks to offer very inexpensive, decentralized data storage for any kind of data."

This will likely change to some form of crypto-native payment model in the near future (e.g., staking Filecoin to increase storage limits), but will remain highly inexpensive due to Filecoin's economic model and 15B+ PiB of capacity. Today, we do subsidize the cost of overhead of running Web3.Storage, but the goal is to reduce this as Filecoin continues to improve (e.g., faster storage and retrieval). Please see <a href='https://spec.filecoin.io/algorithms/cryptoecon/' alt='Filecoin Cryptoeconomics' target='_blank'>here for more on Filecoin economics</a>."

All of your data is accessible via IPFS, and you can simply export all of your CIDs and ask a pinning service to pin them without need to download or upload any data. You have this option even if you use Web3.Storage today and just want another redundant copy of your data persisted. And you don't need to change the URLs that your application is pointing to, since IPFS URLs are content addressable.<br><br>We don't expect to ever discontinue Web3.Storage, but if we need to, we'll give you 90 days' notice for you to make the easy switch."

It's currently not possible to delete files via the API or the client libraries, but we are working on enabling that feature in the near future.<br><br>However, once a file is uploaded to Web3.Storage, there cannot be a guarantee that all copies of the file are gone from the IPFS network. As soon as a file is uploaded, other IPFS nodes can access and store a copy of the data. The data only becomes unavailable when the last IPFS node has stopped pinning the file, and all copies are garbage collected. As a consequence you should only upload to Web3.Storage files that you know can be shared with anyone forever, or are securely encrypted."

The API won't accept raw files above 100MB, so you'll need to package them as .CAR files and chunk them to the right size using CLI tools like <a href='https://github.com/web3-storage/ipfs-car' target='_blank'>ipfs-car</a> and <a href='https://github.com/nftstorage/carbites-cli' target='_blank'>carbites.</a>"

Providing the API token in your front-end will allow anyone to upload files to your account and list already uploaded files. However, we are actively working on ways end-users can upload data directly to Web3.Storage without needing an intermediary!"
